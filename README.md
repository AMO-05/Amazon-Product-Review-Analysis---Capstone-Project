## 🧮 Data Analysis & DAX Expressions

**Key measures used in the analysis:**

- **Employee Below Minimum Pay Count**: Counts employees earning less than $90K  
- **Below Minimum Pay %**: Measures gender gap below regulation  
- **Meets/Exceeds Minimum Pay Count**: Counts those who meet the $90K salary mark  
- **Gender Count Gap %**: `ABS(Male % - Female %)`  
- **Gender Pay Gap %**: `(Average Male Salary – Average Female Salary) / Average Male Salary`  
- **Bonus Amount**: Calculated as `Salary * Bonus %` based on Rating  
- **Bonus %**: Pulled from department-specific rules using `SWITCH(TRUE(), LOOKUPVALUE(...))`
